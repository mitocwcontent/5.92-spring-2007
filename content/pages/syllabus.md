Description
-----------

Energy – where to get it from, how to use it efficiently, and how to reduce negative environmental impacts from its production, conversion, distribution and use – is arguably the most critical environmental and social challenge facing the globe today. MIT President Susan Hockfield has committed the Institute to embark on an ambitious research and education program aimed squarely at the pressing problem of improving energy management. An important component of MIT's Energy Initiative is aimed at "walking the talk" on the MIT campus: improving campus energy management to increase efficiency and reduce both costs and greenhouse gas emissions.

"Energy, Environment and Society" is an opportunity for first-year students to make direct contributions to energy management at MIT and in local communities. The class takes a project-based approach, bringing student teams together to conduct studies that will help MIT, Cambridge and Boston to make tangible improvements in their energy management systems. Students will develop a thorough understanding of energy systems and their major components through guest lectures by researchers from across MIT and will apply that knowledge in their projects. Students are involved in all aspects of project design, from the refinement of research questions to data collection and analysis, conclusion drawing and presentation of findings. Each student team will work closely with experts including local stakeholders as well as leading technology companies throughout the development and implementation of their projects.

Projects are centered on renewable energy, building efficiency, and transportation. Specific project options include:

*   Assessment of MIT wind power options
*   Study of MIT fleets to assess feasibility of increasing vehicle efficiency and switching to alternative, lower-carbon fuels
*   Assessment of energy recovery options for the MIT nuclear reactor
*   Investigation of green building technologies at MIT (i.e. solar thermal, ground source heat pump)
*   Investigation of renewable energy options at Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School
*   Assessment of green building technologies at the Bowdoin Community Center in Dorchester Bay

The real-world nature of projects in this class means that they are inherently multidisciplinary. The intensive teamwork is an ideal opportunity to build valuable skills in addressing real-world problems in a structured environment. Student teams will prepare a project proposal and management plan, a design notebook (in electronic format) a technical report, and a public presentation. Students will also submit four short papers, periodic written and oral progress reports, one peer critique, one presentation of reading highlights, and two homework assignments. Class participation is expected.
